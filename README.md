## Concept Extraction
The process of fine-turning the model and evaluation result is saved in the .ipynb file. The fine-turned models are too large to be placed at GitHub, so they are saved in the google drive folder below. 

The .ipynb file can be runned once the fine-turned model directory is adjusted.
